I have been using .dan.g.'s ToDoList for a very long time now. It's very easy for me to track things that I have to do and also track the projects on which I am working. But there was always a problem related to the creation of task list. My organization uses Microsoft Project (like many other companies) for tracking projects and the cost of development related to these projects. So, I had to make two tasklists, one for the company and the other for myself. ToDoList is much more simpler when compared to Microsoft Project and for daily tracking you don't need rocket applications (like Microsoft Project) to do the tracking. So, I decided to go ahead and make a converter for ToDoList, but the problem was Microsoft Project 2000 didn't support XML, it supported only CVS or tab separated files. Since there wasn't a standard format for the CSV or tab separated files, I chose to make two task lists. Microsoft Project 2002 version had something different, it supported the whole task list to be converted into an XML file and this XML format was standard. This gave me an idea to convert the Microsoft Project 2002/2003 task list to the ToDoList task list.
